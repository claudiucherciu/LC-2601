	- Changed C1-5 footprints from 0804 to 0603
	- Changed L1's footprint to 0603
	- IC1 (atmega) and U4 (mux) now powered at 3V3
	- U5 and U6 (transceivers) now use 3.3V as voltage reference
	- C3 assigned to 3V3
	- Added led on PB0 (blinky)
	- Added led on 5V and 3V3
	- Changed /GPS_OC pull-up voltage to 3V3
	- Changed Programming connector voltage to 3V3
	- Added debug port P2 for UART. Please check pinout!
	- Updated SMA connector GND to Passive to remove ERC error.
	- Updated CAN transceiver GND to Passive to remove ERC error.
	- Updated LDO regulator VOUT pin4 to Passive to remove ERC error.
	- Added thermal relief for the 2 voltage regulators
	
	
TODO:
	- Update connectors footprint
	- ATTENTION: CAN traces are not perfectly equal..
	- ATTENTION: could prove difficult to connect the gps antenna, in the middle of the board..
